# Unreleased — privacy and media hover

- Central dashboard: move the five session shortcuts out of the calendar into
  a labeled `Sessão` menu beside system updates; confirm logout, reboot, and
  poweroff in both entry points, with keyboard navigation and Spotlight search retained.

- Spotlight themes now feature a larger active wallpaper preview and a virtualized gallery with a selectable folder and persistent image choice. A single click selects with a visible border; left/right arrows move selection, and Enter or a double click applies it.
- Gallery touchpad scrolling has kinetic motion and follows the user's conventional direction (fingers down advance). The native folder picker opens above Spotlight, which returns to theme mode after it closes.
- The wallpaper helper lists the full library, preserves the chosen folder, and restores the saved image at login; local Hyprland and labwc startup commands now call it instead of Waypaper.
- Chameleon gains `chameleon-tonal` (Material You Tonal Spot roles) and
  `chameleon-light` variants; `Modo Claro` targets the light variant.
- Theme view: wallpaper gallery with keyboard nav (arrows + Enter,
  WheelKinetic scroll), theme catalog grid, adapter pills; `:config`
  index consolidated from 6 to 4 categories.
- Helper JSON envelopes carry `"version": 1`, pinned by contract tests.
- Labwc support uses native workspaces and Wayland toplevels; session,
  recording, screenshots, and visual checks choose the active compositor.
- The labwc network UI prompts for protected Wi-Fi passwords directly
  (stdin to `nmcli --ask`); `nm-applet` is not used in any session.
- labwc theme follows the shell palette: `theme-manager.py` syncs a new
  `labwc` adapter (`themerc-override` + live reconfigure), and `Theme.qml`
  floors opacity without blur.
- Workspace icons are user-editable: copy `workspaces.json.example` to
  `workspaces.json` (gitignored), set glyphs per position 1–10, and the bar
  hot-reloads on save with fallback to defaults.

- Bar pills: right-click now carries context actions (DND on the bell,
  caffeine on the clock, power on Bluetooth, refresh on Network/Printer/
  Weather, ping on Phone, mute on Audio); middle-click does nothing except
  tray app menus. Tooltips advertise each action; settings stay behind the
  popup header gear.
- Media pill: clicking a hover preview pins it open instead of closing it.
- Tray filters hidden items at the icon source so nm-applet/fcitx5 never
  load theme icons (past KIconLoader SIGSEGV).
- Spotlight matches executables (`Exec=` basename; Flatpak resolves to app
  id + `--command`) and the docs gain `docs/system-setup.md` (Hyprland
  bindings, Flatpak theming, CUPS landscape, retired CopyQ, kdeconnect).

- Traditional start menu (`bar/StartButton.qml` + `bar/StartMenu.qml`):
  left-end pill opening a category browser (categories + app counts on
  the left, apps on the right). Search stays in Spotlight. Entries
  without a resolvable theme icon are hidden.

- Moves Steam game activity from the right-side bar pill into the central
  dashboard's former Theme tile; the tile opens Steam and checks only while
  the dashboard is visible. Theme switching remains in Spotlight.

- Adds a dedicated printing queue window from the compact printer popup, with
  a scrollable pending-document list, manual refresh, and cancellation.

- Self-hiding gaming indicator pill (`bar/Gaming.qml` + `scripts/game-status.py`):
  shows while a Steam game runs (click opens Steam), zero bar space otherwise.

- Shared `components/WheelKinetic.qml`: touchpad 1:1 tracking with kinetic
  glide, adopted by notification, Bluetooth, network, dashboard, clipboard
  and printer scroll views (mouse-notch feel preserved per view).

- Serialize concurrent `bluetoothctl` calls through shared `scripts/bt_ctl.py`
  (lockfile + one retry on SIGABRT) to work around upstream bluez#2434.

- Add battery charge-limit control (Eco 80% / Viagem 100%) to the battery
  popup via `scripts/battery-charge-limit.py`, reusing the power-profile
  selector UI; requires the sudoers rule for `tlp setcharge`/`fullcharge`.
- Auto-restore the 80% limit when the charger is unplugged via the user
  service `tlp-battery-monitor.service`.

- Pass manually entered Wi-Fi passwords and copied network text to helpers
  through stdin instead of command-line arguments.
- Save generated Wi-Fi QR images in a private runtime directory with restricted
  permissions.
- Exclude common local secrets and caches from Git and document a source-only
  sharing workflow; replace personal location examples in documentation.
- Open the compact media panel on hover without grabbing focus, keep it open
  while moving into the panel, and allow a click to keep it open.
- Standardize helper script JSON output contracts across network, bluetooth,
  printer, energy profiles, and weather cities with a predictable envelope:
  `{"ok": bool, "error": str | null, ...}`.
- Catch network and API exceptions in `scripts/weather-cities.py` and output
  structured JSON errors rather than raw Python tracebacks.
- Add `tests/test_contracts.py` ensuring contract conformance and error envelope
  integrity across all helpers.
- Eliminate redundant network and bluetooth background processes by sharing
  bar widget state with the central dashboard ControlCenterCard, avoiding
  duplicate polling when the dashboard is open.
- Add visual regression checklist (`docs/visual-regression-checklist.md`) and
  automated surface and typography verification script (`scripts/visual-check.sh`
  and `./scripts/validate.sh --visual`).
- Decouple QML UI from compositor-specific CLI syntax and commands by introducing
  `scripts/compositor-dispatch.sh`, encapsulating workspace and window focus dispatch
  with automatic Lua (`hl.dsp.*`) and classic hyprlang dual compatibility.
- Ensure native Wayland layer-shell grab focus (`grabFocus: true`) is consistently used across all popups for reliable outside-click dismissal.

- Add an automated compositor agnosticism check to `scripts/validate.sh`, failing
  if any UI QML component directly invokes `hyprctl` or contains Lua dispatcher syntax.
- Document compositor boundary rules in `AGENTS.md` and `docs/architecture.md`.
- Add audio recording toggle to screen recording:
  - Support `--audio` (`-a`) in `scripts/screen-recording.py` to capture audio via PipeWire with `wf-recorder`.
  - Add interactive audio toggle card with animated switch in `bar/ScreenRecordingPopup.qml`.
  - Display audio status indicator (`󰕾`) in bar pill and tooltip during active recordings with sound.
  - Add regression unit tests in `tests/test_screen_recording.py`.
- Add multi-theme support with 7 popular community color palettes:
  - Implement `services/ThemeState.qml` singleton managing live palette switching.
  - Dynamically bind all color tokens in `Theme.qml` to the active theme palette.
  - Curate 7 community themes: Catppuccin Mocha, Tokyo Night, Nord, Gruvbox Dark, Dracula, Rosé Pine, and Catppuccin Latte.
  - Implement `scripts/theme-manager.py` CLI helper with state persistence in `~/.local/state/quickshell/theme.json`.
  - Add interactive theme card to `bar/ControlCenterCard.qml` for single-click theme cycling.
  - Integrate theme switching into Spotlight launcher (`launcher/Spotlight.qml`) via `:tema` and `:theme` filters.
  - Add unit test suite in `tests/test_theme.py`.

# v1.2.0 — Native Wayland Clipboard Backend (SQLite + wl-clipboard)

- **Complete CopyQ Independence**:
  - Migrated clipboard manager from external CopyQ to a native Wayland architecture.
  - Implemented `scripts/clipboard-daemon.py` supervisor using `wl-paste --watch` with singleton file locking (`daemon.lock`).
  - Implemented `scripts/clipboard_store.py` SQLite persistence layer (`WAL` mode, `busy_timeout = 5000`) with dedicated blob store (`~/.local/share/quickshell/clipboard/blobs/`) for image assets.
  - Managed daemon lifecycle directly in Quickshell root via `services/ClipboardService.qml` and `services/ClipboardState.qml`.
- **Notification Hardening (Elimination of Empty/Ghost Notifications)**:
  - Fixed logic flaw where notifications with valid `appName` (e.g. Spotify, Zen Browser) but empty summary and body bypassed filtering.
  - Implemented strict useful content verification (`notificationHasUsefulContent`): requires non-placeholder summary, non-placeholder body, genuine image attachment, or actionable buttons.
  - Added explicit immediate dismissal (`n.dismiss()`) and un-tracking (`n.tracked = false`) for discarded notifications.
  - Enforced content filter directly in `NotificationState.tracked` dynamic property so empty entries are excluded from history and count badge.
  - Added defensive guards in `NotificationToasts.qml` and `NotificationPopup.qml` delegates.
  - Added comprehensive unit test suite in `tests/test_notifications.py`.
- **Bug Fix: Deleted Items Reappearing ("sempre volta")**:
  - Replaced fragile positional indices with permanent SQLite autoincrement IDs and SHA-256 signatures.
  - Item deletion (`Shift+Delete` / `󰆴 Del`) targets exact ID and hash, preventing index shifting race conditions.
  - Added instant local QML filtering in `Spotlight.qml` for instantaneous UI feedback without waiting for background process completion.
- **Loop Prevention & Deduplication**:
  - Automatic detection and suppression of duplicate copies when restoring items via `wl-copy`.
  - Re-copying an existing item bumps it to the top of the history without creating duplicate database rows.
- **Preserved Frontend UX**:
  - Maintained 100% of the Spotlight clipboard UI (`#` / `SUPER+C`): 820×500 split-view, 360px list, preview pane, type badges (`TEXTO`, `LINK`, `CÓDIGO`, `IMAGEM`), aspect-ratio preserved thumbnails, and keyboard navigation.
- **Migration & Testing**:
  - Added `scripts/clipboard-import-copyq.py` for safe one-shot import of existing CopyQ history.
  - Added comprehensive test suite `tests/test_clipboard.py` covering store operations, pruning, restore, deletion, deduplication, and daemon execution.
  - Created detailed architecture documentation in `docs/clipboard.md`.

# v1.1.0 — Spotlight Clipboard Split View, Speedtest & Network Polish

- **Spotlight Clipboard Redesign (Raycast / Alfred Style)**:
  - Dynamically expands from 560px to 820×500px in clipboard mode (`#` or `SUPER+C`) with smooth easing transitions.
  - Implements 2-column split view: 360px filterable results list on the left, live preview pane on the right.
  - Preserves full text formatting, indentation, and newlines up to 8,000 characters in `JetBrainsMono Nerd Font` with mouse selection.
  - Renders image previews with preserved aspect ratio for PNG, JPEG, WebP, and SVG formats.
  - Adds semantic badges (`TEXTO`, `LINK`, `CÓDIGO`, `IMAGEM`) and live metrics (line/char counters).
  - Unblocks `Enter` activation immediately without waiting for background cache refresh.
  - Expands history search to 50 items with full text search across content.
  - Adds `PageUp`/`PageDown` navigation (6 items per page) and `Shift+Up`/`Shift+Down` preview scrolling.
  - Introduces `monoFontFamily` design token in `Theme.qml`.
- **Network Speedtest & IPv6 Fix**:
  - Forces IPv4 address resolution in `scripts/network-speedtest.py` to prevent 30-second socket timeouts on dual-stack connections.
  - Implements live chunked upload test over `HTTPSConnection`.
  - Harmonizes Network popup (`bar/NetworkPopup.qml`) with `glassBorder`, `glassBorderSubtle`, and unified `󰅖` close action.
- **Notification Subsystem**:
  - Adds dedicated documentation (`docs/notifications.md`) covering toasts, server, popup contract, and HTML entity decoding.

- Arrow navigation, Enter launch and Escape close.
- Mouse selection/activation.
- `> command` mode.
- `= arithmetic` mode.

  Bluetooth, Audio or OSD.

# v0.20.17 — compact Quickshell-style tooltips

Base: v0.20.16.

- Fixes tooltip line breaks by replacing `Text.RichText` with `Text.PlainText`.
- Tooltip max width reduced from 440px to 320px.
- Uses the shell surface color instead of the full popup background.
- Radius reduced to 7px with a softer 1px border.
- Typography reduced to 11px with compact line spacing.
- Existing tooltip strings are untouched, so Weather/Network/Bluetooth hints now
  naturally render their existing `\n` as separate lines.
- No updater, media, player selector, notification, Weather, Network or Bluetooth
  behavior changes.
- Script executable bits are preserved.

# v0.20.16 — fault-isolated update center

Base: v0.20.15.

- Clock updates area now opens a compact 326px update center.
- Separates official Arch repositories, AUR, Flatpak and Homebrew.
- Adds AUR update discovery with a 15s query timeout so a slow AUR endpoint cannot stall the shell.
- Right-click on the Clock update area still toggles the compact R/A/F/B breakdown.
- Each backend can be updated independently.
- “Atualizar tudo” runs repo -> AUR -> Flatpak -> Brew as isolated stages.
- An AUR failure/timeout no longer prevents Flatpak or Homebrew stages from running.
- Real package updates run in a terminal; Quickshell only presents state and launches the runner.
- Adds package-list expansion inside the update center.
- All shell scripts are explicitly executable in the release.
- No changes to Media, player selection, Weather, notifications, Network, Bluetooth, Audio, fan or OSD.

# v0.20.15 — dot separator between Workspaces and Media

Base: v0.20.14.

- Replaces the 1px vertical separator between Workspaces and Media with the
  same subtle middle-dot treatment already used in the center cluster.
- Uses theme grey at 75% opacity and 12px typography for visual consistency.
- No other bar, media, Clock, Weather, notification, fan, update, Network,
  Bluetooth, Audio or OSD changes.

- Separator is vertically centered and uses the same subdued grey treatment
  already used elsewhere in the shell.
- No other bar, media, Clock, Weather, notification, fan, update, Network,
  Bluetooth, Audio or OSD changes.

# v0.20.13 — left-side player selector anchoring

Base: v0.20.12.

- Corrects PlayerSelector placement for the left side of the bar.
- Uses the mirrored anchor/gravity relationship of the working right-side popups:
  target bottom-left -> popup opens toward the bottom-right.
- Fixes the v0.20.12 behavior where the menu was clamped to the screen's top-left corner.
- No notification changes.
- No media state/sticky-player changes.
- No Weather, Clock layout, fan, updates, Network, Bluetooth, Audio or OSD changes.

# v0.20.12 — player selector popup placement fix

Base: v0.20.10 stable.

- Fixes PlayerSelector popup gravity.
- The selector now opens downward from its target instead of expanding upward/off-screen.
- Applies to both the Media selector in the top bar and the shared selector in the Clock popup.
- No media state/sticky-player changes.
- No notification changes; SwayNC remains untouched.
- No Weather, Clock layout, fan, updates, Network, Bluetooth, Audio or OSD changes.

# v0.20.10 — sticky media player

Base: v0.20.9.

## Media selection behavior
- The current MPRIS player is now sticky.
- Pausing Spotify no longer causes the Now Playing state to jump to Firefox.
- Manual player selection still takes precedence.
- The selected/current player remains active while it still exists in MPRIS.
- Automatic fallback happens only when the current player disappears.
- If no sticky/current player exists, a playing player is preferred, then the first available player.

Because the Clock popup shares Media.qml state, the fix applies consistently to both the bar and Clock popup.

No visual changes.

# v0.20.9 — shared Now Playing selector

Base: v0.20.8.

## Shared media state
The Clock popup now reuses the exact Media.qml instance from the bar.

- `Bar.qml` passes `mediaWidget` to Clock as `mediaController`.
- `Clock.qml` forwards that controller to CalendarPopup.
- CalendarPopup reads the same `players`, `player`, and `selectedPlayer`.
- Selecting a player in the Clock popup writes directly to
  `mediaWidget.selectedPlayer`.
- A player change made from the bar is immediately reflected in the Clock popup.
- A player change made from the Clock popup is immediately reflected in the bar.

## UI
- Adds a small player selector to the media section inside CalendarPopup.
- Uses the existing `PlayerSelector.qml`; no duplicate selector logic.
- Existing artwork/title/artist/progress/controls continue using the shared
  `mediaWidget.player`.

## Intentionally unchanged
- MediaPopup remains intact.
- MPRIS discovery/deduplication remains entirely in Media.qml.
- Bar Now Playing appearance/hover controls remain unchanged.
- Weather, Network, Bluetooth, Audio, OSD, fan and update logic are untouched.

# v0.20.8 — footer divider alignment

Base: v0.20.7.

- Rebuilds the Clock popup footer using anchored left/right halves.
- Vertical divider is now anchored exactly to the horizontal center.
- CPU/Fan and Updates regions use the divider as their shared boundary.
- No typography, fan logic, update logic, popup size, or Weather changes.

# v0.20.7 — fan reader syntax fix

Base: v0.20.6.

- Fixes QML parse failure in CalendarPopup.
- Removes embedded multiline shell/template literal from QML.
- Moves fan detection to `scripts/fan-speed.sh`.
- CalendarPopup now executes the helper directly.
- Fan behavior remains the same: ThinkPad first, generic hwmon fallback, 5s refresh.
- No visual changes.

# v0.20.6 — fan speed in Clock popup

Base: v0.20.5.

- Adds live fan RPM telemetry to CalendarPopup.
- Prefers ThinkPad hwmon (`thinkpad` / `thinkpad_hwmon`) fan inputs.
- Falls back to the first readable generic `fan*_input`.
- Fan state refreshes every 5 seconds while the popup is open.
- CPU and fan share the existing left footer area, so popup geometry stays unchanged.
- No Weather, Network, Bluetooth, Audio, OSD, or bar layout changes.

# v0.20.5 — remove bottom chin

Base: v0.20.4.

- CalendarPopup height reduced from 374 px to 358 px.
- Removes the ~16 px empty area below the CPU/updates footer.
- No typography, spacing, media, calendar, update logic, or Weather behavior changed.

## Weather
- removed the redundant `Gerenciar cidades` footer;
- city management remains available from the city selector and `+` button at the top;
- reduced outer margins and popup height;
- increased primary weather text slightly.

## Clock
- reduced outer margins and total popup height;

No backend behavior changed.

# v0.20.3 — popup typography pass

Base: v0.20.2.

## What changed
- increased font sizes across the Clock popup (calendar, music and footer);
- increased font sizes across the Weather popup (city header, current conditions, hourly strip, daily list and footer row);
- slightly enlarged both popup canvases so the bigger typography still breathes;
- preserved the same layout language and floating visual style.

No backend logic changed in this release.

# v0.20.2 — update counts + final popup polish

Base: v0.20.1.

## Update count fix
- `checkupdates`, `flatpak` and `brew` are now discovered robustly even when
  Quickshell runs from a systemd user service with a reduced PATH.
- Common absolute executable locations are used as fallback.
- CalendarPopup refreshes all three update sources whenever it opens.
- Added `scripts/debug-updates.sh` for quick backend diagnosis.

## Clock popup

- click toggles compact `A x · F y · B z` breakdown;
- no more truncated `Sistema atualiz...`;
- artwork slightly larger;
- media/title grouping tightened;
- calendar slightly shorter;
- popup slightly shorter.

## Weather popup
- slightly shorter overall;
- daily forecast labels made a little easier to read.

Weather and Clock remain independent PopupWindow instances.
No unrelated modules changed.

## WeatherPopup
- reduz altura total e remove espaço vazio inferior;
- aumenta levemente a largura;

Nenhuma arquitetura foi alterada.
Weather e Clock continuam sendo dois PopupWindow independentes e podem abrir separadamente.

# v0.20.0 — floating dual-popup redesign

Base: user-provided v0.19.1 package.

## Independent popups
Weather and Clock remain two real, independent `PopupWindow` instances.

- Weather opens only WeatherPopup.

- Audio
- Network
- Bluetooth
- Battery
- Tray
- Notifications

# v0.19.1 — estabilização do Weather multi-cidade

Base: v0.19.0.

## Correções
- Não mostra previsão em cache de outra cidade após trocar a seleção.
- Scroll sobre o Weather usa o `MouseArea` já existente da pill.
- Lista de cidades salvas agora é rolável.
- Seletor e busca recebem altura suficiente para não cortar a previsão.
- Nenhuma mudança na aparência normal da barra.

## Testes realizados
- compilação dos scripts Python;
- listagem do estado;
- adicionar duas cidades;
- selecionar cidade;
- alternar próxima/anterior;
- remover cidade selecionada;
- persistência do JSON de estado.

O ambiente de geração não possui o executável Quickshell, portanto a validação
final do carregamento QML continua sendo feita no sistema do usuário.

# v0.19.0 — cidades salvas no Weather

Base: v0.18.0.

## Weather
O módulo passa a suportar várias cidades persistentes.

### Barra
- continua exibindo apenas ícone + temperatura;
- scroll no módulo troca entre cidades;
- tooltip informa a cidade ativa.

### Popup
Novo seletor de cidade no topo:
- localização automática;
- cidades salvas;
- indicador `✓` na cidade ativa;
- remoção individual;
- `+ Adicionar cidade`.

### Busca
`Adicionar cidade` usa o geocoding do Open-Meteo:
- busca pelo nome;
- mostra cidade + região + país;
- clicar em um resultado salva e seleciona imediatamente a cidade.

### Persistência
Estado salvo em:

`~/.local/state/quickshell/weather.json`

Exemplo:

```json
{
  "selected": "cidade-exemplo-...",
  "cities": [
    {
      "id": "...",
      "name": "Cidade Exemplo",
      "region": "Região Exemplo",
      "country": "Brasil",
      "latitude": 0.0,
      "longitude": 0.0
    }
  ]
}
```

### Backend
- `scripts/weather-cities.py`: lista, busca, adiciona, seleciona, remove e
  alterna cidades.
- `scripts/waybar-wttr.py`: usa a cidade selecionada antes de consultar o
  Open-Meteo.
- localização por IP continua existindo como opção `Localização automática`.

Nenhum outro módulo da shell foi alterado.

# v0.18.0 — simplificação visual

Base: v0.17.2.

## Barra
- Remove a pill visível de temperatura da CPU.
- O sensor continua ativo em segundo plano para alimentar o popup central.
- Move Weather do lado direito para o centro, ao lado do relógio.
- Weather central usa apresentação `plain`, sem pill permanente forte.
- Demais módulos do lado direito continuam intactos.

## Popup central
Agora só existem dois cards internos reais:
1. calendário;
2. música.

Data/hora e CPU ficam diretamente no fundo do popup, sem cards extras.

### Cabeçalho
- hora grande;
- data completa;
- CPU pequena no canto direito;
- temperatura não compete mais visualmente com o relógio.

### Música
- artwork ligeiramente maior;
- título, artista e controles;
- remove o rodapé com nome do player.

### Updates
- remove o card/faixa de atualizações;
- vira apenas uma linha discreta;
- mostra total + Arch + Flatpak + Brew quando existem updates;
- com zero updates mostra somente `Sistema atualizado`;
- mantém clique nas origens para abrir atualização;
- mantém refresh manual.

## Filosofia visual
A barra fica mais "glanceable" e o popup central deixa de parecer um
dashboard composto por cards aninhados.

# v0.17.2 — correção de carregamento

- Corrige `CalendarPopup.qml`: adiciona `import qs.components`.
- Isso torna `CommandJson` disponível para o resumo de updates.
- Nenhuma alteração visual em relação à v0.17.1.

# v0.17.1 — updates no popup central

Base: v0.17.0.

## Barra
- Remove o módulo `Updates` da barra.
- Arch / Flatpak / Brew deixam de ocupar pills permanentes.

## Popup central
Adiciona um rodapé compacto de atualizações:

- total de updates;
- Arch + quantidade;
- Flatpak + quantidade;
- Brew + quantidade;
- botão de refresh.

Não mostra lista de pacotes.

### Interação
- clicar em `Arch` abre `pacman -Syu` no Ghostty;
- clicar em `Flatpak` abre `flatpak update`;
- clicar em `Brew` abre `brew upgrade`;
- botão de refresh atualiza as três contagens.

## Visual
O resumo usa o mesmo card discreto dos outros blocos do popup central e ocupa
apenas uma faixa curta no rodapé.

Nenhum módulo de rede, Bluetooth, áudio, weather, bateria ou notificações foi alterado.
